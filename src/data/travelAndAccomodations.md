### Travel and Accomodations

We recommend either carpooling, or utilizing taxi or Lyft services to the venue. If you choose to drive, paid parking is available on Fisher Loop, just above the Golden Gate Club, for about $2.00. The lot is free after 6pm.

**TBD** Because taxi and Lyft service can be difficult to call from within the park, we will offer limited shuttle service out of The Presidio at the end of the night.

**TBD** We have limited rooms reserved at [Inn at the Presidio](http://www.innatthepresidio.com/), a boutique hotel less than a 5-minute walk from the Golden Gate Club. To reserve a room under our block, mention the “Córdova/Mariano” block when you call. There are also a vast number of inns and hotels on Lombard Street, right outside of The Presidio.
