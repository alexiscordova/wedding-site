We recommend either carpooling, or utilizing taxis and on-demand car services (Lyft, Uber, etc.) to the venue. If you choose to drive, paid parking is available on Fisher Loop, just above the Golden Gate Club, for about $2.00. The lot is free after 6pm.

We have limited rooms reserved at [Inn at the Presidio](http://www.innatthepresidio.com/ "Inn At the Presidio - Boutique Hotel"), a boutique hotel less than a 10-minute walk from the Golden Gate Club. To reserve a room, provide group code **882** when you call [(415) 800-7356](tel:4158007356 "Phone number for Inn at the Presidio") or visit their website to make a reservation. Reservations will be available until February 15. If you are having trouble finding accommodations or need additional help, feel free to [reach out to us](mailto:alexisandkrystle@icloud.com).
