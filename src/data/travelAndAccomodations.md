We recommend either carpooling, or utilizing taxi or Lyft services to the venue. If you choose to drive, paid parking is available on Fisher Loop, just above the Golden Gate Club, for about $2.00. The lot is free after 6pm.

We have limited rooms reserved at [Inn at the Presidio](http://www.innatthepresidio.com/ "Inn At the Presidio - Boutique Hotel"), a boutique hotel less than a 10-minute walk from the Golden Gate Club. To reserve a room, mention the “Córdova/Mariano” block when you call. [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/s/135-Fisher-Loop-San-Francisco--CA/homes?checkin=2018-04-27&checkout=2018-04-29&allow_override%5B%5D=&s_tag=c6tIxIwQ "Airbnb rentals near the Presidio") is also a good option, as well as the many inns and hotels on Lombard Street right outside the Presidio. If you are having trouble finding accomodations or need additional help, feel free to [reach out to us](mailto:alexisandkrystle@icloud.com).
