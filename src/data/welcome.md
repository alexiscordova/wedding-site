Hello and welcome! If you’re reading this, this means you received our Save the Date! This will be the go-to resource for all wedding-related details, and we’ll continue to update it as the date approaches. A formal invitation will follow soon, but until then if you have any questions, please [email us](mailto:alexisandkrystle@icloud.com).

You are all very special to us, and your support means everything. We can’t wait to celebrate with each and every one of you next April in San Francisco!

Love,
Alexis Córdova and Krystle Mariano
