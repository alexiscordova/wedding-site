Alexis & Krystle's Wedding Site
---

We're getting married, so we needed a website. The URL, which by the way is the greatest, is [itsacelebrationbitches.life](http://itsacelebrationbitches.life), until we register one more suitable for distribution (something like [alexisandkrystle.com](http://alexisandkrystle.com)).

Built with React.js, Babel, Webpack, Sass, ESLint, StyleLint, Browserslist, PostCSS, and a bunch of other cool stuff. This is also the first test of my [React-StarterKit](https://github.com/alexiscordova/react-starterkit).

### Get Started
Make sure Node.js is installed.

```
npm install
npm start
```

### Build
```
npm run build
```
